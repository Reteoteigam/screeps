 * global.hasRespawned()
 *
 * @author:  SemperRabbit
 * @version: 1.1
 * @date:    180331
 * @return:  boolean whether this is the first tick after a respawn or not
 *
 * The checks are set as early returns in case of failure, and are ordered
 * from the least CPU intensive checks to the most. The checks are as follows:
 *
 *      If it has returned true previously during this tick, return true again
 *      Check Game.time === 0 (returns true for sim room "respawns")
 *      There are no creeps
 *      There is only 1 room in Game.rooms
 *      The 1 room has a controller
 *      The controller is RCL 1 with no progress
 *      The controller is in safemode with the initial value
 *      There is only 1 StructureSpawn
 *
 * The only time that all of these cases are true, is the first tick of a respawn.
 * If all of these are true, you have respawned.
 *
 * v1.1 (by qnz): - fixed a condition where room.controller.safeMode can be SAFE_MODE_DURATION too
 *                - improved performance of creep number check (https://jsperf.com/isempty-vs-isemptyobject/23)
